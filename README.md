# METEOR

The following are sources for the program FORM, which is an interactive program that generates input for METEOR, and METEOR itself. Note that the C sources have been automatically translated from Pascal, and have a library prepended to be self-contained. The original Pascal is much more readable.

[C source for the input formatter, form.c (translated from Pascal)](form.c)

[Pascal source for the input formatter, formJ.p](formJ.p)

[C source for main program, meteor.c (translated from Pascal)](meteor.c)

[Pascal source for main program, meteorJ.p](meteorJ.p)

[Test input file for form (to edit) or meteor (to run)](test.met)

The following paper describes the FIR filter design program called METEOR, which is based on linear programming.
